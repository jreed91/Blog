    		<h1><a href="/2014/01/07/living-with">That Terrible Word</a></h1>

		    <div>
		    	<p>On December 19th, the day after my 22nd birthday, I came to what I hoped was going to be a normal winter break where we get together with all our family and celebrate the holidays and our numerous birthdays. But this year was not like the rest, not even close.</p>

<p>My father has been dealing with a lot of pain over the past year. About a year ago he went into the doctors because of pain in his hip and back, he got an mri and it showed nothing but a herniated disk and some arthritis. Jump all the way to this November and he was still suffering from the same pain. His doctor figured it was just his herniated disk and had no reason to order another MRI but on a gut feeling decided to order another one. This turned out to be a decision that will forever change my father’s life and my entire family’s.</p>

<p>The results came back from this MRI showing a couple lesions on his spine. In order to know exactly what was causing these lesions, a biopsy had to be done. One of the worst things about cancer or anything medically related is the waiting. The weeks between hearing you have lesions on your spine and before you know what is causing it are the worst. Constant searching on the internet of my father’s symptoms only made it worst. The darkest, bleakest cancers come out when you search the internet. The incurable blood related diseases, or dabilitating cancers of the spine make you worry more and more.</p>

<p>Between December 4th when I first heard about the lesions and December 19th when we learned the results of the biopsy I was kept out of the loop. Unfortunately the doctors told them that it is cancer during this time but didn’t say exactly what kind until the biopsy came back. I don’t blame my parents for not telling me, they just wanted me to complete my second to last semester of college and not have me worry.</p>

<p>The day I came home my mother and father met with the doctor to hear the results. I didn’t go along as I felt this was an occasion where they should be together without us children. But that was the longest few hours of waiting of my life.</p>

<p>When my parents finally arrived home they were almost happy. Because they had thought the worst the results that did come back were better than what we had in mind. Maybe we were a bit naive or maybe we just weren’t informed enough nut over the next few weeks this happiness changed once we realized the extent of the cancer.</p>

<p>The results were surprising, he had Melanoma. He had lesions on his spine, lung, adrenal gland, and brain. We would later find out that this was much more extensive. My father had never noticed an unusual mole and after a thorough examination a few weeks later we still haven’t found one. This plays in our favor because this could mean that his immune system has already fought off the primary site. Only about 5% of cases have an unknown primary.</p>

<p>There wasn’t much time to let this soak in as the next day he began his first treatment. After the constant worrying beforehand I made a promise to myself to not research this disease in order to remain positive. But on Christmas day I broke this promise and it made me realize how deadly melanoma is. Looking up stats of people with Stage IV melanoma and that only 10% survive 6 months. I broke down that night it really put a damper on Christmas but as I look back, knowing what were fighting against is better than not knowing.</p>

<p>As the days went by after his first treatment my father continued to deteriorate and experience more pain. He started to have mini panic attacks from the simplest things like trying to decide what type of soup to eat. My father stopped being able to sleep, which we later find out to be because of a tumor on the exact part of your brain that helps you sleep. On December 29th, my father experienced a rigor (uncontrollable shaking) which can attributed to a very high temperature. This happened while I was home alone with him. I had to call 911 (which was a rather frustrating experience since I had to explain my situation twice, once to the dispatcher and second to the medic). He was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he statyed for the next 4 days. The hospital helped him considerably get back to a “normal”.</p>

<p>But on the last day we were dealt another blow, we learned that the disease has continued to progress with a new lesion on his eye. This was the first really visible sign of the diease which is what I think made it so traumatic.</p>

<p>The next day we went to Iowa City to get a second opinion with one of the leading melanoma doctors in the country. This was a rollercoaster of a day. It was the first time where everyone realized the extent of the cancer when his CT/PET scan was shown. This was one of the most traumatic images for all of us. I didn’t think the day could get any worse but the doctor was able to end the day on a high note and we left feeling positive that we could beat this terrible disease.</p>

<p>The response by all of our friends and family have been great, I think we have enough food to last us out the rest of the year. Having a support system like this has meant everything to us. Cancer is like a giant elephant in the room, you can’t ignore it, it’s always there and having a support system outside just our family gives us the brief moments we need where we can ignore it.</p>

<p>We continue to stay positive, we know each day is a new journey and each day I know he is going to get better. I tell myself each morning that he can be one of 10% and that we can beat this disease. I look for positive signs and hold on to those moments. I cherish every moment have with my father and I know I will continue to cherish for years to come. One of the moments that I continue to hold on to is something my father told on Christmas night. He told me he was going to run a 5K next year and you know what, I believe him.</p>
